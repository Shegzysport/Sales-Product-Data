# Sales and Product Data
 Im using PowerBI to create a relationship and visualization between Sales Data and Product Data
 # Data collection and Cleaning 
  - I import Sales data and product data from excel files where i transform it into PowerBI
  - I did the first cleaning by removing Top three blank rolls
  - Then i use first roll as headers and i removed the null values
  - Then i did replace value
  - Then i added a new custom column where i wrote some Dax ( IF and else )
    # Data Processing 
  - Then i close and apply to powerBI Quary Editor
    # Data Visualization

    # Data Intepretation From Dashboard
       - We can observe that the hightest product sold was Wheat flour then followed by Oil
       - We can see between food product and drink, people bought food more than drink
       - From the Revenue by channel pie chat we can see the highest revenue was gotten from Retail followed by Distributor
